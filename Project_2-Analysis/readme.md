# Excel Data Analytics: Insights into Data Science Careers

## Introduction

As a former job seeker, I’ve often been struck by the lack of data analyzing the best jobs and skills in the data science market. This inspired me to explore which skills top employers prioritize and how to secure higher pay.

## To analyze the data science job market, I considered the following questions:

**- Do additional skills lead to higher pay?**

**- What are the salary ranges for data jobs in various regions?**

**- Which skills are most valued among data professionals?**

**- How much do the top 10 skills earn on average?**

## 🔧 Excel Skills Used

**The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:**

**🧭 Pivot Tables** – To explore data from different angles with dynamic summaries

**📊 Pivot Charts**– For visual storytelling through charted insights

**🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions**) – Crafting powerful measures for deeper analysis

**🧼 Power Query** – Streamlining data cleaning and transformations

**🧩 Power Pivot** – Integrating data models with calculated relationships

## Data Jobs Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of real-world data science job information from 2023, including detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and skills.

**It includes detailed information on:**

👨‍💼 Job titles
💰 Salaries
📍 Locations
🛠️ Skills

### 1️⃣ Do more skills get you better pay

## 🔍 Skill: Power Query (ETL)

### **Extract**

I first used Power Query to extract the original data (data_salary_all.xlsx) and create two queries:

🗃️ First one with all the data jobs information.

🔧 The second listing the skills for each job ID.

### **Transform**

Then, I transformed each query by changing column types, removing unnecessary columns, cleaning text to eliminate specific words, and trimming excess whitespace.
